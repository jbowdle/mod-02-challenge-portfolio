### Mod 02 Challenge: Portfolio

## Challenge Description:

This challenge asked for a completed portfolio webpage. It was required to be personalized and be ready to showcase my work. It needed to have functional links where necessary and be responive.

## Features:

* There is a navigation bar, an about section, a portfolio section, and a contact section.

* The webpage is responsive and has adjusted layouts for phones, tablets, and larger screens.

* Links to within the webpage are functional, along with a functional project link and GitHub link.

* The project cards have a "highlight" effect on hover, which can be easily seen on the CSS Snippet Cheatsheet card. When the mouse hovers over, it will go from a greyscale to full color image.

## TODO:

* As more high quality projects are finished, they will be used to populate the portfolio sections.

* When this page will be used as a visible portfolio for employers, the resume, phone, and email links will be updated with correct information and fully functional links.
